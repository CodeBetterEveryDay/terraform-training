# Terraform Training

Learn Terraform by deploying a todo application on public cloud infrastructure
in various configurations. Learn how to write Terraform configuration, refactor
Terraform configuration into modules, automate Terraform operations, and develop
a Terraform provider. The course will start by deploying the todo application to
a single environment and then learn how to scale that deployment up and deploy
to multiple environments. This course is for engineers looking to integrate
Terraform into their workflows and engineers looking to take the
[Terraform Associate](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate)
certification exam.

This course is designed to be taught in an instructor-led classroom environment.
While most of the concepts and code are present in the material, there are
contextual concepts that the instructor will cover in course.
